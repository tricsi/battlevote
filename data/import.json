It hates the light!\" - Anonymous 2020</p><p>You've accidentally fallen down into a hidden bunker while participating in the latest viral Facebook event, Raid Area 404 (don't bother looking, it's a private group). There seems to be something down here with me, better get out as fast as I can. </p><p>Raid Area 404 is a survival/stealth/horror game. Controls are as follows<br>\n\t\t\t\t\t* arrow keys - move<br>\n\t\t\t\t\t* A - activates a switch<br>\n\t\t\t\t\t* S - scooches down (otherwise known as crouching)<br>\n\t\t\t\t\t* Hold shift - run</p><p>Should you need to use stealth for any reason, it works this way. An opponent can see in all directions at all times, but cannot see around corners (much; make sure you get right into the corner if you are hiding in a small space). Running makes noise, which will bring enemies to your location, however walking is silent. Due to the environmental conditions, visibility is limited to approximately 7 meters (your character is 1.5 meters tall, for reference).</p>", "category": ["desktop"], "image": "/games/raid-area-404/__big.jpg"}},
