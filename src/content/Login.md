# js13kVote
Vote by comparing two randomly selected games\
with each other, then move on to the next pair.

## Details of "1vs1 battle"
We're changing the rules this year - instead of trying to play\
all the games to score them fairly, you will be presented with\
two random games to compare and decide which one of them is\
better in given criteria: Innovation, Fun, Theme, Gameplay,\
Graphics, Audio, and Control. You can also mark any of them as a tie.

Only those who submitted a game are allowed to vote. Be aware that\
we need as many votes as possible to end up with solid results, so\
please vote for at least 20-30 pairs. You won't be allowed to vote\
for your own game, and for the same games twice though.
